# Sam Moser

I am a mechanical engineering student at Missouri University of Science and Technology, and will be graduating with my bachelor's in the spring of 2016. I have extensive knowledge in automotive repair, especially in the mechanical systems of a vehicle. I consider my hands on experience to be my main asset as a mechanical engineer. This is because I have personal experience with the various failure modes in the transportation industry (automotive and recreational) to apply to future engineering projects.

#### Education

## Missouri S&T

Bachelor of Science (BS), Mechanical Engineering (expected 2016)
